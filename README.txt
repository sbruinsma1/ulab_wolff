	DATA

VWRA data is located in the VWRA directory. It contains all data combined into one .csv file in the "cogVWRA" subdirectory. It also contains raw data generated by Laffayette software from individual experiments in the other subdirectories, which includes a user-generated "params.txt" file containing group data and the irradiation date.

Raw Y-maze and open field data are in the "YMaze" and "OpenField" directories. They are .txt files generated by Stoelting ANYmaze software. Group info is included in "groups.txt" files in the appropriate subdirectory. "YMaze/correctEntries.csv" was written using the "arenaTests.writeYMazeCorrectEntries" function, which can be regenerated but it takes a while to run.

Reversal learning data is contained in the "phenotyper" folder. The "distance.txt" file contains the sum total distances moved for every minute of recording, and the files in the "pokeLists" subdirectory are the results of parsing raw data for each nosepoke. There are 1.5 terabytes of raw data (video files and raw exported coordinates and nosepoke information for each video frame), so they are not included here, but they could be made available on requests.

BDNF data is located in the "BDNF" folder, which contains unedited images in the .pdf file and densitometry data in the .csv file.

	FIGURES

You can generate the published figures using functions defined in allFigures.py. The contents of data.zip must be extracted into the same directory as the .py files. 

These functions were all written in python 3.7.1 using the Anaconda 3 distribution and the Spyder IDE. The python scripts import functions from the directory in which they are located, so that path may need to be added to your path list in order to run any of the code.

These functions require python 3, the unedited data files, and the following python modules:
 - json (version 2.0.9)
 - numpy (version 1.18.1)
 - scipy (version 1.4.1)
 - pandas (version 1.0.0)
 - matplotlib (version 3.1.3)
 - seaborn (version 0.10.0)
